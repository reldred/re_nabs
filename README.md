reldred's North American Building SetThis is the old ae_nabs project ported back to NFO from GRFMaker.New grfid, new graphics from Oz and Lifeblood who unfortunantly aren't around anymore.Credits:Coding, if this abortion can even be described as such: reldred (formerly known as Aegir)Art: Oz, Lifeblood, reldredLicense/Permissions:I don't really feel comfortable attaching anything to this as I've not been able to get ahold of Oz (who's been out of touch for 7years) or Lifeblood (10 years) but lets for the sake of sanity just declare it as the following: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.A good deal of their work is already included in CC'd or GPL'd projects, and as the original coder/maintainer of NABS before another set/coder took over before later withdrawing their published works. I publish this then in good spirit, if the original artists surface and redeclare their intentions for their artwork then licensing will be revisited at a later date.Contact:Preferably here through github, or go hassle reldred on OFTC/#openttd.
